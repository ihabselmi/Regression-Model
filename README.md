# Regression-model
Usingcrimedatafromhttp://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.txt (fileuscrime.txt, description at 
http://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.html ), use regression to predict the observed crime rate in a city with the following data:
M = 14.0
So = 0
Ed = 10.0
Po1 = 12.0 Po2 = 15.5
LF = 0.640
M.F = 94.0 Pop = 150
NW = 1.1
U1 = 0.120
U2 = 3.6 Wealth = 3200
Ineq = 20.1 Prob = 0.04 Time = 39.0
Show your model (factors used and their coefficients), the software output, and the quality of fit.
